# Wordlist Manager

## Usage:

    //Convert files first if not already done
    ./convert

    //Make wordlist files
    ./create

    //Remove wordlist files
    ./remove

---

Simply make a folder for each wordlist you want to create.

Put all the files you want to combine, sort and deduplicate into this folder.

The bash script will walk trough all folders and combine the contents to `wordlist.lst`
